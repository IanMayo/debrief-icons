## Workflow
### Initial
1. Designer logs into GitHub
2. Designer forks this repo
3. Designer uses GitHub client (such as SourceTree) to clone the repo to their local disk

### Per-Issue
1. Designer starts GitHub issue
2. Designer does "Pull" on their local copy of the repo
3. Designer creates local branch from master (something that includes the issue number and a brief summary of the issue subject, like ````issue4_file_types````)
4. Designer works on .ai icon files locally
5. Designer commits changed/new .ai files to local copy
6. Designer generates .png files at the correct size, in the relevant directories
6. Designer then creates Pull Request (from client, or from relevant branch in web browser)
7. Project lead reviews Pull Request, potenially asking designer to update designs, finally merges updated icons.
